/**
 * Casper Tests
 *
 * Functional browser tests for checking that the Ghost Admin UI is working as expected
 * The setup of these tests is a little hacky for now, which is why they are not wired in to grunt
 * Requires that you are running Ghost locally and have already registered a single user
 *
 * Usage (from test/functional):
 *
 * casperjs test admin/ --includes=base.js [--host=localhost --port=2368 --noPort=false --email=ghost@tryghost.org --password=Sl1m3r]
 *
 * --host - your local host address e.g. localhost or local.tryghost.org
 * --port - port number of your local Ghost
 * --email - the email address your admin user is registered with
 * --password - the password your admin user is registered with
 * --noPort - don't include a port number
 *
 * Requirements:
 * you must have phantomjs 1.9.1 and casperjs 1.1.0-DEV installed in order for these tests to work
